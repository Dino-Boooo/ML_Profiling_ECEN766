This directory contains the following files:
- seq.fasta: File containing the gold-standard protein sequences
- seq.label: File containing the complete EC labels for the gold-standard protein sequences
- ec_fullnames.txt: File containing full enzyme names correspoinding to the EC labels
- ec_mapping.tsv: File containing the mapping of gold standard proteins to EC labels
- ec_lengths.tsv: File containing the average protein lengths per EC bin. This file is to 
		  be used in abundance matrix generation step of Carnelian
- info.tsv: File containing additional information about the gold-standard proteins from 
	    the UniProt database
- negative_examples:
	- neg.fasta: File containing example sequences generated by randomly shuffling every 
		     two positions of the gold standard proteins. These can be used as negative
		     examples while training the classifier ensemble.
	- neg.label: File containing labels for the negative examples. We create a special
		     bin "N.N.N.N" for the negative examples.


Note: To train Carnelian, include some randomly shuffled sequences with the sequences in seq.fasta and label them 
as "N.N.N.N" in the seq.label files. This will create a "negative" bin for putting the input sequences which do not resemble
any of the gold standard prokaryotic proteins. Example shuffled sequences are given in negative_examples folder. You can
chose your own sequences too.
