# Benchmarking Transformer-Based Metagenomic Functional Profiling: A Comparison with Alignment Methods
This repository contains code and data to evaluate DeepECtransformer, a transformer-based deep learning model, for metagenomic functional annotation. We benchmark its performance against traditional alignment-based tools like HUMAnN3 and ML-based methods like Carnelian, using both clean validation data and real-world metagenomic benchmarking sets.
